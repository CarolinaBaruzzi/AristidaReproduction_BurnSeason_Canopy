## Analyses and data for: Baruzzi, C., N. Medina-Irizarry, M.N. Armstrong, and R.M. Crandall. Fire season and canopy cover interact to affect reproduction of a pyrogenic bunchgrass, Aristida beyrichiana. Plant Ecology, Accepted.

This repository provides the data and R code for the analyses presented in the research article Baruzzi, C., N. Medina-Irizarry, M.N. Armstrong, and R.M. Crandall. Fire season and canopy cover interact to affect reproduction of a pyrogenic bunchgrass, _Aristida beyrichiana_. Plant Ecology, Accepted.

1. The dataset `Aristida_Flowering.csv` contains data on the first two analyses presented in the article: probability of reproduction and number of inflorescences produced by plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.

2. The dataset `Aristida_Germination.csv` contains data on the last analysis presented in the article: probability of germination of wiregrass seeds collected under open and partially closed canopies from plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.

3. The file `Aristida_Flowering.R` runs the code for the analyses and related figures for probability of reproduction and number of inflorescences produced by wiregrass plants burned in each burn season under opens and partially closed canopies.

4. The file `Aristida_Germination.R` runs the code for the analysis for probability of germination for plants burned in the early wet season under open and partial canopies. The code for the probability of germination figure shows probability of gemination of wiregrass seeds collected under open and partially closed canopies from plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.
