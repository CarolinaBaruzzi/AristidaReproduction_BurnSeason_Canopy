## Analyses and data for: Baruzzi, C., N. Medina-Irizarry, M.N. Armstrong, and R.M. Crandall. Fire season and canopy cover interact to affect reproduction of a pyrogenic bunchgrass, Aristida beyrichiana. Plant Ecology, Accepted.

This repository provides the data and R code for the analyses presented in the research article Baruzzi, C., N. Medina-Irizarry, M.N. Armstrong, and R.M. Crandall. Fire season and canopy cover interact to affect reproduction of a pyrogenic bunchgrass, _Aristida beyrichiana_. Plant Ecology, Accepted.

1. The dataset `Aristida_Flowering.csv` contains data on the first two analyses presented in the article: probability of reproduction and number of inflorescences for plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.

2. The dataset `Aristida_Germination.csv` contains data on the last analysis presented in the article: probability of germination of wiregrass seeds collected under open and partially closed canopies from plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.

3. The file `Aristida_Flowering.R` runs the  analyses for probability of reproduction and number of inflorescences for each burn season.

4. The file `Aristida_Germination.R` runs the analyses for probability of reproduction and number of inflorescences for each burn season.
