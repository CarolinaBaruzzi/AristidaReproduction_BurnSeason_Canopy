# AristidaReproduction_BurnSeason_Canopy

This repository provides the data and R scripts for the analyses presented in the research article "Fire season and canopy cover interact to affect reproduction of a pyrogenic bunchgrass, Aristida beyrichiana".

1. The dataset `Aristida_Flowering.csv` contains data on the first two analyses presented in the article: probability of reproduction and number of inflorescences for plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.

2. The dataset `Aristida_Germination.csv` contains data on the last analysis presented in the article: probability of germination of wiregrass seeds collected under open and partially closed canopies from plants burned during the early-dry, mid-dry, and early-wet seasons.

3. The file `Aristida_Flowering.R` runs the  probability of reproduction and number of inflorescence analyses.

4. The file `Aristida_Germination.R` runs the  probability of reproduction and number of inflorescence analyses.
